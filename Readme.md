# CadmusApi

API layer for the Cadmus content editor.

Please find other [documentation](doc/index.md) under `doc`.

## Profile

A Cadmus profile is a JSON document used to define items facets, parts, flags, and taxonomies (thesauri).

When the backend API starts, the profile is used to seed a not-existing database. The location of this profile is read from the environment variable named `SEED__PROFILESOURCE` (Linux; `SEED:PROFILESOURCE` in Windows).

If this is not specified, a default mock profile is used. This typically happens when launching the API just for the sake of experimenting with a mock database. This profile is named `seed-profile.json`, and is located under `wwwroot` in the `cadmus_api` repository.

The profile source can either be a file name, or an HTTP(S) resource; in the latter case, it is assumed that it starts with `http`.

When the profile source is a file name, it may contain directory variables between `%`. Currently, the variable `%wwwroot%` is reserved to resolve to the web content root directory; any other variable name is searched in the configuration.
